# Breast-Cancer
* Predicting tumor type using Sklearn's breast cancer dataset. 
* I did not have to do a lot of data cleaning and the data was balanced. 
* This was part of my revision of Linear classifiers so I only used the SVM Linear classifier.
* The aim was to be able to predict if a tumor is malignant or benign
* The scatter plot below (and others) hinted at a linear model being sufficient
* Final model predictions are summarized in the confusion matrix below
